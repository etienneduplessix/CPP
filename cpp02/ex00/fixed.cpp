You think you know integers and floating-point numbers. How cute.
Please read this 3 pages article (1, 2, 3) to discover that you don’t. Go on, read it.
Until today, every number you used in your code was basically either an integer or a
floating-point number, or any of their variants (short, char, long, double, and so forth).
After reading the article above, it’s safe to assume that integers and floating-point numbers have opposite caracteristics.
But today, things will change. You are going to discover a new and awesome number
type: fixed-point numbers! Forever missing from the scalar types of most languages,
fixed-point numbers offer a valuable balance between performance, accuracy, range and
precision. That explains why fixed-point numbers are particularly applicable to computer
graphics, sound processing or scientific programming, just to name a few.
As C++ lacks fixed-point numbers, you’re going to add them. This article from
Berkeley is a good start. If you have no idea what Berkeley University is, read this
section of its Wikipedia page.
Create a class in Orthodox Canonical Form that represents a fixed-point number:
• Private members:
◦ An integer to store the fixed-point number value.
◦ A static constant integer to store the number of fractional bits. Its value
will always be the integer literal 8.
• Public members:
◦ A default constructor that initializes the fixed-point number value to 0.
◦ A copy constructor.
◦ A copy assignment operator overload.
◦ A destructor.
◦ A member function int getRawBits( void ) const;
that returns the raw value of the fixed-point value.
◦ A member function void setRawBits( int const raw );
that sets the raw value of the fixed-point number.
